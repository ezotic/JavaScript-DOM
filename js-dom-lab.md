## JavaScript and the DOM Lab





### The Set-Up


- Fork and clone this repository locally and in Visual Studio Code

- Push up your changes to the remote repository



### Tasks

#### Part One

1. Create an HTML file called `js-dom.html`

    - Must have global HTML document structure

2. Add two `<p>` elements without content. 

3. Give each `<p>` element an `id` and value

4. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

5. Create scripts for each exercise:

    - Write a script to add "We are coders!" to the `<p>` element.

    - Find the *first* `<p>` element and change its text to "Developers for life!"

    - Add an image to the HTML document using DOM methods

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

    - Write a script to change the color of the text from black to your favorite color

    - Add a script to change the font size of the first `<p>` element to `40px`

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

    - Add a button to the HTML document

    - Add a script that hides the image when the button is clicked

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.


#### Part Two

1. Create an HTML file called `about.html`

    - Must have global HTML document structure

2. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

3. Create a simple "About Me" webpage and using JS and the DOM to manipulate elements.

4.  Title your webpage *About Me* and add this code
```html
<ul>
    <li>Nickname: booboo</li>
    <li>Favorites: music, pizza, The Office</li>
    <li>Hometown: Wilmington </li>
    <li>Random Fact: Black is my favorite color.</li>
</ul>
```

5. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

6. Nest those values within a `span` element and give each an `id`

7. Create a JS file named `main.js` and link to the HTML document

8. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

9. Complete the following tasks below using the DOM methods:

    - Change the body style so it has a `font-family` of `Arial, sans-serif`.

    - Replace each of the values with your own information.

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

    - Change the `<li>` style to a color of your choosing. Cannot be black.

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

    - Find a picture and add to the project.

    - Create a new `img` element and set its `src` attribute to a picture of you. Append the image to the web page.

        > Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

#### Part Three

Using the great power of the DOM and its methods, iterate through the elements in the HTML document and create a Table of Contents that will be at the top of the webpage. 

1. Create a new HTML file and add the code below.

```html
<body>
    <div >
        <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div >
        <h1>Fruits</h1>
        <h2>Red Fruits</h2>
        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <h3>Raspberry</h3>
        <h2>Orange Fruits</h2>
        <h3>Orange</h3>
        <h3>Tangerine</h3>
        <h1>Vegetables</h1>
        <h2>Vegetables Which Are Actually Fruits</h2>
        <h3>Tomato</h3>
        <h3>Eggplant</h3>
    </div>
</body>
```
2. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.

3. Add a script to the HTML document that iterates through the elements and creates a table of contents. The table of contents should be at the top of the webpage. 

4. Stage, commit, and push changes. Let Git be on your team.
